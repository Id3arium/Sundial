# Cut a GitHub release for the current version of Sundial.

# Reads the version from project.yml (MARKETING_VERSION) — the single source of
# truth — tags it v<version>, builds a fresh Release .app, zips it, and creates
# a GitHub release with auto-generated notes and the zip attached.
#
# Usage:
#   ./release.sh          # build, tag, and publish the release
#   ./release.sh -h       # this help
#
# Safety: refuses to run on a dirty or unpushed tree, and won't overwrite an
# existing version. To release a new version, bump MARKETING_VERSION in
# project.yml first, commit, and push.
